# Kail HiMCM 2018 (Problem B)
KAIL submissions to HiMCM 2018 problem B, which asks for participants to develop a purely quantitative roller coaster ranking system based on factors such as height, length, time, building material, etc. We plan to use supervised learning to fit a LightGBM regressor using the engineered feature from quantitiative coaster data with target of a current ranking system based on purely subjective coaster reviews.
